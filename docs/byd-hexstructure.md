# Structure of BYD HVS Messages

## Captureing of messages
These messages and decrypted by capturing the communication between the software Be Connect and the hardware. The position and information of each information is interpreted by the community and may be incorrect. Please take only valid information from BYD or its sub-companies.


## Messages

After a TCP Connection is estalished the communication requires to send a command to receive data or execute a measurement. The project of smarthomeNG describe it as a similarity for ModBus that we read and write registers with the TCP connection.
